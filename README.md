# UI Clustering

This project represents the third and final assignment for the course Artifical Intelligence. This project was written entirely in the Python programming language. 
Cluster Analysis or Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some specific sense defined by the analyst) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data analysis, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.
There are 2 different algorithms present: K-Means algorithm utilising centroids and K-Means algorithm utilising medoids.

This project was completed on 11.12.2022.
